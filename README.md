Module 3 Challenge

The following files are provided in this repo:

For PyBank: budget_data.csv in Resources folder, bank_results.txt in Analysis folder, main.py on the same level as the Resources and Analysis folders.

For PyPoll: election_data.csv in Resources folder, poll_results.txt in Analysis folder, main.py on the same level as the Resources and Analysis folders.

Code in line 41 in the PyBank main.py file was provided by AskBCS.

Tutor Simon Rennocks helped me a lot in this assignment (both in terms of the logic and the syntax) - especially in the PyPoll part as the logic I was trying to use was terrible.
